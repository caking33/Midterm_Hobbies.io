# Midterm_Hobbies.io
My objective for this mini-website is to showcase three of my hobbies: art, baking, and reading. I want to display my hobbies in a way that is fun while also showing my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. To start off, I will create a simple header that includes a logo, tag-line and a three-tab navigation bar that will toggle through each hobby that makes up the body section. The body section will include short descriptions and my own imagery of each hobby. Lastly for the footer, I will keep it simple again with a social media link, boilerplate, and a static image of myself in a fake shark head that I will use to theme the overall mini-website.  My end goal for this assignment is to show my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while also creating a piece that is entertaining to view. Â© 2023 Copyright: Chetiera King. All Rights Reserved.
